# Tset Assignment using Selenium, Java and page object model

# Tester Challenge

Background:
In order to calculate the total cost of a part it is necessary to understand the pricing structure of the underlying material. How a material is priced depends on negotiations with suppliers, and is broken down into multiple “price components”. The amount of these components varies, and the sum of all components will define the final price.
In order to cover this use case, we need a form that allows adding new /removing existing price component fields, where the sum of the price component values is displayed as a total price.

Goals:
Setup Selenium test framework, using Java
Implement Test Case against provided Vue app

# Testcase
